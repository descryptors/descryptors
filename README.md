__Descryptors__  makes finding and monitoring cryptocurrency projects easy. Our goal is to be transparent and neutral.

https://descryptors.io



## Building

To build __Descryptors__ you will need to install [__Clojure CLI tools__](https://clojure.org/guides/getting_started).


### Start Backend

```
clj -A:backend
```

After building the Clojure code, it will load the data files (if specified), start the webserver and a REPL on port `3311`.

See [conf/config.edn](/conf/config.edn).

Descryptors uses [__Roll__](https://github.com/dimovich/roll) for backend.

### Start Frontend

```
clj -A:frontend
```

This will start Figwheel which will build the ClojureScript code.

Descryptors uses [__Proto__](https://github.com/descryptors/proto) for React components and charts.

### Open

After building is done, navigate in your browser to `localhost:5000`. If you start only the backend, the pages will be rendered on the server.


## Data

The project comes with some sample data located in `data` folder. This includes basic information about the cryptocurrency projects and a precomputed index for marketcap and code activity.

If you'd like to add more information please see the [__Data__](https://github.com/descryptors/data) project.
